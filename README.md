# Milk-V Duo Resources
**English resources for Milk-V's Duo single board computer!**

_This guide is incomplete! Please feel free to leave a pull request to add more information. :)_

## Intro

I have recently purchased a [Milk-V Duo](https://milkv.io/duo) from China. Unfortunately due to the product's lack of official availability in other countries such as the US, most info and discussion about it is in mostly Chinese. I want to change this by providing English speakers with resources to easily work with the Duo.

## Plans for the future

* Add community made boards
* Add English translated guides from the forums

## How to Buy

The Duo is not officially available in China as prevously mentioned. However, you can get them through third party sellers on AliExpress! You can buy a board for around $10-15 USD not including shipping. [Here is an example](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805512900866.html). You can find more by searching for "Milk-V" on AliExpress.
